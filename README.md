## HELLO WORLD
# THIS IS A SIMPLE TC TAC TOE GAME I MADE
I made this in python using tkinter.
## Versions of the file
There are 3 versions of the file.
- Game.py
- WorkingGame.py
- WorkingGameAgainstPc.py

I think the names are self explainatory but I will write a little about them. 
- Game.py is a basic version of the game in which there are no rules. It is very baisc and it is not really a game.
- WorkingGame.py is a better version of the game in which you can play with your friend
- WorkingGameAgainstPc.py is an even better version of the game which you can play against the PC. (It's actually very easy, I have just hard-coded what to play)
